# Week 2 – Day 4: Modular Flask APIs with Blueprints

## Overview
This day focuses on structuring a Flask application in a **modular and scalable way** using Blueprints and utility modules. The goal was to move from a single-file Flask app to a production-style project structure.

## What I Learned
- Flask **Blueprints** for separating routes
- Creating reusable **utility functions**
- Validating API request data
- Organizing code into `routes` and `utils` packages
- Testing APIs using **Postman**
